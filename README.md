# dogs_trust

:dog: This is a dashboard that I created at the first R ladies hackathon in London in September 2018. :dog:

The Markdown script can be used to create a html dashboard containing summary of which breed of dog is most likely to be rescued from which rescue centre.

[Crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) developed by [Joe Cheng](https://twitter.com/jcheng?lang=en) extends html widgets with interactivity using sliders, radio buttons and filters. 

## Getting Started

You can clone this repo by typing the following into the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/mrmoleje/dogs_trust
```
## Pre-requisites

In order to run this you'll need R Studio installed, as well as the following libraries: dplyr, leaflet, DT, crosstalk, RColorBrewer , readr, ggplot2.

## Data

Due to an NDA the data was deleted at the end of the event. For this reason the dashbaord wont run, however the code can be used to create a similar product.
